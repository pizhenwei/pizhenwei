Hi, I’m @pizhenwei

👀 I’m interested in the Linux operating system and lots of software. I've contributed to Linux, util-linux, QEMU, libvirt, libiscsi, spdk,tgt, Redis, bcc, atop.
- I’m currently working on Virtio Over Fabrics specification, Linux driver demonstration code and Virtio-oF target.
- I developed [Valkey over RMDA](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey/blob/unstable/src/rdma.c), the new feature has been merged into Valkey 8.0. This allows clients to communicate with Valkey server by RDMA, it's possible to improve the QPS to ~250%. and reduce latency to ~50%.
- I developed virtio crypto kernel driver and QEMU backend, this allows guest to offload RSA/ECDSA to host. It's possible to let nginx(with openssl) improve the performance of HTTPS to ~200%. I started to maintain the cryptodev subsystem of QEMU since 2023-03.
- I contributed lots of patches to [atop](https://github.com/atoptool/atop), and recently I'm developing [atophttpd](https://github.com/pizhenwei/atophttpd) which is a web style atop, this allows to access atop without login, it's also possible to get system level/process level status of many servers in batch.
- I wrote `irqtop/lsirq/blkpr` commands(from [util-linux](https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux)), any suggestion/feedback is welcome!
- I wrote `hugetop` command(from [procps](https://gitlab.com/procps-ng/procps)), any suggestion/feedback is welcome!
- I wrote `tcprtt/virtiostat/rdmaucma` commands, improved `runqslower/killsnoop/trace/funccount` commands(from [bcc](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)), any suggestion/feedback is welcome!
- I'm familiar with iSCSI/iSER/NVMe-OF, contributed patches to libiscsi/spdk/tgt/kernel nvme target, I also developed a user space NVMe-oF initiator [libnvmf](https://github.com/bytedance/libnvmf) which makes QEMU block as faster as ~200K IOPS.
