- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pizhenwei
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the Linux operating system and lots of software. I've contributed to Linux, util-linux, QEMU, libvirt, libiscsi, tgt, Redis, bcc, atop.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on: 1, virtio crypto kernel driver and QEMU backend, this allows guest to offload RSA/ECDSA to host. The latest test shows that it's possible to let nginx improve the performance of HTTPS to ~200%. 2, Redis over RMDA, this allows clients to communicate with Redis server by RDMA, it's possible to improve the QPS to ~300%.
